# Python Fundamentals Project

my mini  project demonstrates basic Python concepts:
- Variables (strings, integers, lists, dictionaries)
- Conditionals (if/elif/else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Built-in functions: enumerate, range, id
- String to int casting
- Command-line arguments using argparse



   files

  
- `data_analyzer.py`: Main script demonstrating Python fundamentals
- `utils.py`: Reusablefunctions








The Document Processor project is a Python application designed to load, validate, and display structured document data from a JSON file. Each document is represented as a dataclass with typed fields such as id, title, tags, published, and optional metadata. The application handles missing or optional fields gracefully, ensuring that all documents are displayed clearly without errors. It uses modern development tools like mypy for type checking, ruff for linting and formatting, and pre-commit hooks to automatically enforce code quality before commits. This project demonstrates professional Python practices, including proper project structure, type safety, error handling, and maintainable, readable code.
